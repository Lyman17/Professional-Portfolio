<h2>Credits</h2>

The intent of this project was to write as much of the code by yourself as possible.

For use of Study, the Author enjoyed the following sites & resources:
FlexboxZombies.com
FlexboxFroggy.com

Reviewing course work from the UofU bootcamp
as well as one on one time with the TA's during office hours helped with my troubleshooting needs to get to this point in the project.

Completing the ReadMe was assisted with research from the following site:
